# ModalMerge Source Code

This directory contains the implementation of the ModalMerge framework. The complete implementation is available in the Jupyter notebook file, which you can run in Google Colab or any other Jupyter environment.

## Code Structure

The implementation is organized into the following modules:

- `__init__.py`: Package initialization
- `model.py`: Core MultiModalModel implementation with cross-attention
- `encoders.py`: Modality-specific encoder implementations
- `decoders.py`: Modality-specific decoder implementations
- `attention.py`: Cross-attention mechanism implementation
- `data.py`: Dataset and dataloader utilities
- `train.py`: Training utilities and Trainer class
- `visualize.py`: Visualization utilities

## Implementation Notes

The implementation focuses on:

1. **Modular Design**: Each component (encoder, decoder, attention) is implemented as a separate module
2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with Python type hints
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and comments
4. **Visualization**: Tools for understanding model behavior and outputs
5. **Medical Applications**: Specialized implementations for medical imaging

## Required Dependencies

```
torch>=1.10.0
torchvision>=0.11.0
numpy>=1.20.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0

## How to Use

The Jupyter notebook will be uploaded separately and contains a complete walkthrough of the implementation and examples.
