## Overview

ModalMerge is a state-of-the-art implementation of diffusion models for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data analysis. This project demonstrates how modern generative AI techniques can be applied to neuroimaging data to enable:

- **Brain activity pattern generation**: Creating synthetic but realistic fMRI data
- **Spatiotemporal modeling of neural dynamics**: Capturing both spatial and temporal aspects of brain activity
- **Decoding of cognitive states from brain activity**: Predicting what task or stimulus a subject is experiencing
- **Anomaly detection in brain imaging data**: Identifying unusual patterns that may indicate pathology

By leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the project captures the complex distributions of brain activity patterns in both spatial and temporal dimensions, enabling more sophisticated analysis of fMRI data than traditional methods.

## Dataset

This project uses the OpenNeuro dataset DS000102 (Visual categorization task), which contains functional MRI data from subjects performing visual categorization tasks.

### Dataset Acquisition Process

Unlike traditional methods of fetching datasets directly in code (which can be problematic for large neuroimaging datasets), we used a more robust approach:

1. **DataLad Download**: 
   - The dataset was downloaded using DataLad, which is specifically designed for efficiently managing large datasets
   - Command: `datalad install https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds000102.git`

2. **Google Drive Storage**:
   - The downloaded dataset was added to Google Drive for persistent storage

3. **Colab Integration**:
   - Google Drive was mounted in the Colab notebook
   - The dataset was accessed directly from the mounted drive

This approach ensures reliable access to the dataset and avoids the common issues with directly downloading large neuroimaging datasets in Colab.

### Dataset Characteristics

The DS000102 dataset features:
- Task-based fMRI data with visual categorization tasks
- Multiple subjects and runs
- High-quality preprocessed data suitable for analysis
- Rich metadata including task conditions and timing information

## Technical Approach

### Libraries and Frameworks

This project leverages several specialized libraries for neuroimaging and deep learning:

- **MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI)**: Core framework used for medical imaging-specific deep learning components
  - Provides specialized tools for medical image handling
  - Optimized implementations of 3D U-Net and other medical imaging architectures
  - Medical-specific transformations and augmentations

- **PyTorch**: Base deep learning framework
  - Implementation of custom diffusion models
  - Optimization and training utilities

- **Neuroimaging Libraries**:
  - NiBabel: For reading/writing neuroimaging file formats
  - Nilearn: For brain image visualization and processing

- **Specialized Components**:

  - torchsde: For stochastic differential equations in diffusion models
  - tqdm, matplotlib, plotly: For visualization and progress tracking

This combination of libraries enables efficient handling of complex 4D fMRI data (3D volumes over time) while implementing state-of-the-art diffusion models.
