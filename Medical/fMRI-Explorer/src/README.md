# Source Code

This directory contains the implementation of the fMRI Explorer project.

The complete implementation is available in the Jupyter notebook (`fMRI_Explorer.ipynb`) in the parent directory, which provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the entire analysis pipeline.

## Main Components

- Data loading from public neuroimaging datasets
- Preprocessing pipeline with spatial and temporal filtering
- Brain visualization utilities
- ROI-based time series extraction
- Functional connectivity analysis
- Statistical modeling with GLM
- Advanced visualization techniques

Please refer to the notebook for the complete implementation with explanations.
